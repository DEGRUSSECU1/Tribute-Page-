            Italian architect, noted for his constructive work in the cities of Quito and Buenos Aires during the first half of the 20th century. Born on November 19, 1891 in Catania (Sicily), he was the second of three children of the marriage of Salvatore Russo and Anna Scuderi, owners of a farm in the town of Granmichele. His brothers were Estéfano Salvatore (1882-1913) and Paolo (1885-1971).

        He completed primary studies in his hometown, secondary studies in Turin and later attended the Faculty of Architecture of the Royal University of Milan, where he graduated in 1910 with the title of engineer-architect. His specialty in reinforced concrete construction was the reason why that same year he would travel to South America, hired by the Government of Bolivia to design and build the Lake Titicaca dock.
        
        At the end end of his contract he traveled to Argentina, where his older brothers, also architects, practiced the profession, founding the construction company Russo Hermanos, which carried out several works in the city of Buenos Aires with a very peculiar eclectic style and art-nouveau features that they would characterize most of Antonino's work in the future.
        
        A year after the death of their older brother in 1913, Antonino and Paolo traveled to Ecuador encouraged by some compatriots who resided in the country and assured them that there was a good market for them to develop their careers. They settled in the city of Quito and entered the Central University to endorse their degrees, which they would achieve on May 18, 1918.
        
        They re-founded a construction company called "Russo Hermanos", and although they worked together on some projects, they were free to do it also on their own or in association with other architects of the time. Its radius of action also included other cities such as Ambato, Ibarra, Riobamba, Loja and Montecristi.
        
        On October 1, 1920 Antonino married the Quito lady Concepción Villacís Franco, with whom he had seven children: Ana, Fernando, Francisca, Elsa, Giovanna, Mario and Marcelo. For his part, his brother Paolo moved permanently to Guayaquil in 1922, a city to which he traveled with his wife Luz Emilia Moreano Muñoz and developed a great career until his death in 1971.
        As a teacher, Antonino was a professor in the chair of architecture at the School of Fine Arts, later converted into the Faculty of Architecture and Engineering of the Central University of Ecuador, where he taught almost until his last days. In the public sphere, he was Head of Construction of the Ministry of Public Works, head of the Department of School Construction of the Ministry of Education, and Head of Construction of the Pension Fund, a position from which he promoted the popular housing project in the current area of the Alpahuasi, south of Quito.

        The long and fruitful career of Antonino Russo would end up consecrating his name, along with those of Francisco Durini, Luis Felipe Donoso Barba, Giacomo Radiconcini, Alfonso Calderón Moreno and Rubén Vinci Kinard, as part of the most important modernizers of the Ecuadorian capital during the Andean belle époque, raising it to the architectural level of the great European cities. He would even be decorated by Pope Pius XII with the title of Commander of the Order of San Silvestre, for his services to the Vatican with the construction of the Palace of the Nunciature in Quito in 1946.

        Finally, the famous architect Antonino Russo Scuderi died in the city of Quito on February 8, 1967, being buried in the San Diego Cemetery to which he had made so many contributions with splendid mausoleums, but where a simple and elegant tombstone on the floor recalls his last resting place, where he lies in eternal rest with his wife.
